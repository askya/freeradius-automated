#
#  This next section is here to allow testing of the "inner-tunnel"
#  authentication methods, independently from the "default" server.
#  It is listening on "localhost", so that it can only be used from
#  the same machine.
#
#	$ radtest USER PASSWORD 127.0.0.1:18120 0 testing123
#
#  If it works, you have configured the inner tunnel correctly.  To check
#  if PEAP will work, use:
#
#	$ radtest -t mschap USER PASSWORD 127.0.0.1:18120 0 testing123
#
#  If that works, PEAP should work.  If that command doesn't work, then
#
#	FIX THE INNER TUNNEL CONFIGURATION SO THAT IT WORKS.
#
#  Do NOT do any PEAP tests.  It won't help.  Instead, concentrate
#  on fixing the inner tunnel configuration.  DO NOTHING ELSE.

#  Authorization. First preprocess (hints and huntgroups files),
#  then realms, and finally look in the "users" file.
#
#  The order of the realm modules will determine the order that
#  we try to find a matching realm.

#  Make *sure* that 'preprocess' comes before any realm if you
#  need to setup hints for the remote radius server

#  Authentication.
#
#
#  This section lists which modules are available for authentication.
#  Note that it does NOT mean 'try each module in order'.  It means
#  that a module from the 'authorize' section adds a configuration
#  attribute 'Auth-Type := FOO'.  That authentication type is then
#  used to pick the appropriate module from the list below.
#

#  In general, you SHOULD NOT set the Auth-Type attribute.  The server
#  will figure it out on its own, and will do the right thing.  The
#  most common side effect of erroneously setting the Auth-Type
#  attribute is that one authentication method will work, but the
#  others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the Auth-Type attribute by hand
#  is to either forcibly reject the user, or forcibly accept him.

#  Post-Authentication
#  Once we KNOW that the user has been authenticated, there are
#  additional steps we can take.
#
#  Note that the last packet of the inner-tunnel authentication
#  MAY NOT BE the last packet of the outer session.  So updating
#  the outer reply MIGHT work, and sometimes MIGHT NOT.  The
#  exact functionality depends on both the inner and outer
#  authentication methods.
#
#  If you need to send a reply attribute in the outer session,
#  the ONLY safe way is to set "use_tunneled_reply = yes", and
#  then update the inner-tunnel reply.
